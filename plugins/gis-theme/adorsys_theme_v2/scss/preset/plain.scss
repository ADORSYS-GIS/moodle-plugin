/**
 * Plain preset file.
 *
 * This preset now uses Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI instead of Bootstrap.
 * FontAwesome has been removed in favor of modern icon systems.
 *
 * To create your own preset file:
 * - Duplicate this file and rename it, for instance to preset-apple.scss.
 * - In settings.php, find the references to 'plain', duplicate them and rename
 *   them to 'apple'. (Look around the choices for 'theme_boost/preset').
