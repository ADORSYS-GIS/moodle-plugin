**Plugin Name:** Open AI Compatible AI Provider
**Type:** AI Provider Plugin for Moodle

**Description:**
The Open AI Compatible AI Provider plugin integrates Moodle with any AI service that follows the OpenAI-compatible API schema. It enables seamless text generation, code generation, and other language-model-driven capabilities directly within Moodle’s AI framework.

This provider allows administrators to configure their own API keys and endpoints, giving full control over which OpenAI-compatible model or service is used (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic-compatible services, third-party compatible LLMs, or self-hosted models). Once configured, the plugin can be used across Moodle subsystems that support AI integration such as content generation, question authoring assistance, tutoring tools, and automation plugins.

**Key Features:**

* Supports OpenAI-compatible API endpoints.
* Text generation for content creation, explanations, summaries, and learning support.
* Code generation for technical courses, developer training, and example solutions.
* Fully configurable API keys, model names, and endpoint URLs.
* Works with Moodle’s native AI services architecture.
* Extensible and suitable for multiple AI use-cases across Moodle activities.

**Intended Use:**
This plugin is ideal for institutions or course creators who want to integrate modern AI capabilities into Moodle while maintaining flexibility and vendor independence.
